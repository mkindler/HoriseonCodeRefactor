# HoriseonCodeRefactor

## Description

This project is a website design for Horiseon, a company that focuses on helping businesses develop and maintain their online social presence.

## Task

The requirements of this project included updating the code of the web page to follow accessibility standards, while maintaining the overall aesthetic and usability of the website.  The end project resulted in a functioning, deployable web page.

## Usage

This website can be shared with clients of Horiseon to promote their services, and is up-to-date with accessibility standards and optimized for search engines.

## Installation

This project will require a user to have:
* `Git Bash` (Windows), `Terminal` (Mac), or another application for executing commands to/from one's local machine.
* Code editor installed, such as `Visual Studio Code`.
* Version control system, such as `GitHub`, to fork, clone, push, and pull the original repository, and to upload the final project to one's own version control system account.

## Process

This project began with a set GitLab repository that included the base `html` file and all assets, including the CSS stylesheet and images needed for the web page.

Upon analysis of the HTML file and CSS stylesheet, the components that required adjustments for accessibility purposes, updating broken links, consolidating styling properties, and producing an overall logical structure were identified.

**Accessibility Adjustments Made**

* Changing `div` elements to `section`, `article`, and `nav` elements as appropriate, thereby utilizing semantic HTML.
* Structuring `html` elements to follow a logical flow regardless of styling and positioning.
* Ensuring all `img` elements contain descriptive alt attributes.
* Reviewing the order of the heading attributes and updating the footer header to fall in sequential order.
* Updating the `title` element to display the full name of the company, Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

**Structure and Styling Changes Made**

* Commented out both the `html` file and CSS stylesheet to include descriptions of code and styling effects used.
* Adjustment of class attributes to consolidate styling properties.  This included creating the following class attributes based on each of the following `section` class attributes:

    *`section` class="content"*
    - "content-block"
    - "float-right"
    - "float-left"
    
    *`section` class="benefits"*
    - "benefit-block"
